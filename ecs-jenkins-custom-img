If you want to install Jenkins on AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) without using the official Jenkins Docker image, you’ll need to build and deploy your own Docker image that includes Jenkins. Here’s a step-by-step guide to accomplish this:

### 1. **Prepare Your AWS Environment**

1. **Create an IAM Role for ECS:**
   - Go to the IAM console.
   - Create a new role with the `AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy` policy.
   - Attach this role to your EC2 instances.

2. **Create a VPC (if you don’t have one):**
   - Navigate to the VPC dashboard.
   - Create a new VPC with public and private subnets as needed.
   - Set up an Internet Gateway and route tables.

### 2. **Set Up Your Docker Environment**

1. **Install Docker:**
   - Install Docker on your local machine or a build server if you haven’t already.

2. **Create a Dockerfile:**
   - Create a `Dockerfile` to define your Jenkins installation. Here’s a basic example:

     ```dockerfile
     # Use a base image that includes Java
     FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim

     # Install Jenkins
     RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget gnupg && \
         wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | apt-key add - && \
         sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list' && \
         apt-get update && apt-get install -y jenkins

     # Expose Jenkins port
     EXPOSE 8080

     # Start Jenkins
     CMD ["java", "-jar", "/usr/share/jenkins/jenkins.war"]
     ```

   - Save this Dockerfile in a directory.

3. **Build and Test Your Docker Image:**
   - Navigate to the directory with your Dockerfile and build the image:

     ```sh
     docker build -t my-jenkins-image .
     ```

   - Test the Docker image locally:

     ```sh
     docker run -p 8080:8080 my-jenkins-image
     ```

   - Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to verify Jenkins is running.

### 3. **Push Your Docker Image to a Repository**

1. **Push to Amazon ECR:**
   - Go to the Amazon ECR console and create a new repository.
   - Authenticate Docker to the ECR registry:

     ```sh
     aws ecr get-login-password --region <your-region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com
     ```

   - Tag and push your Docker image:

     ```sh
     docker tag my-jenkins-image:latest <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com/my-jenkins-repo:latest
     docker push <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com/my-jenkins-repo:latest
     ```

### 4. **Create an ECS Cluster**

1. **Open the ECS Console:**
   - Go to the ECS section in the AWS Management Console.

2. **Create a New Cluster:**
   - Select “Create Cluster” and choose “EC2 Linux + Networking”.
   - Configure the cluster settings (name, instance types, number of instances, etc.).
   - Ensure the cluster is using the appropriate VPC and subnets.

### 5. **Create an ECS Task Definition**

1. **Define a New Task Definition:**
   - Go to the ECS console and select “Task Definitions”.
   - Create a new task definition with the “EC2” launch type.
   - Add a container definition:
     - **Container Name:** Jenkins
     - **Image:** `<account-id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com/my-jenkins-repo:latest`
     - **Memory Limits:** Configure based on your needs (e.g., 2048 MiB).
     - **Port Mappings:** Set container port to `8080`.
   
2. **Configure Task Role:**
   - Set up any required IAM roles for the task if needed.

### 6. **Create an ECS Service**

1. **Open the ECS Console:**
   - Go to the “Services” section.

2. **Create a New Service:**
   - Select the cluster you created.
   - Choose “Create” and select the task definition you created.
   - Set the service type to “EC2” and configure the number of tasks to run.
   - Configure load balancing if needed (optional for simple setups).

3. **Configure Networking:**
   - Ensure that your security groups allow inbound traffic on port 8080 (or the port configured for Jenkins).

### 7. **Launch and Access Jenkins**

1. **Verify ECS Instances:**
   - Check that ECS instances are running and are part of the cluster.

2. **Access Jenkins:**
   - Obtain the public IP address or DNS name of your ECS instances from the EC2 console.
   - Navigate to `http://<public-ip>:8080` in a browser to access Jenkins.
   - Complete the Jenkins setup wizard, which will require an unlock key found in the Jenkins container logs.

### 8. **Finalize Jenkins Configuration**

1. **Install Plugins:**
   - Access the Jenkins setup and install recommended or additional plugins as needed.

2. **Configure Jobs:**
   - Set up Jenkins jobs, pipelines, and other necessary configurations.

### Additional Considerations

- **Monitoring and Logging:** Use CloudWatch for monitoring and logging.
- **Backups:** Regularly back up Jenkins configurations and data.
- **Security:** Secure Jenkins with SSL and appropriate access controls.

By following these steps, you can deploy Jenkins on AWS ECS without using the pre-built Jenkins image, providing you with the flexibility to customize your Jenkins environment.
