Explanation:
Base Image: jenkins/jenkins:lts is the long-term support (LTS) version of the official Jenkins Docker image.
Python 3: Installed via apt-get, along with pip3 for Python package management.
AWS CLI: Installed using pip3, the official Python package installer.
Docker CLI: Installed from Docker's official APT repository, allowing Jenkins to interact with Docker (Docker-in-Docker support is optional and requires extra setup).
Terraform: Installed from HashiCorp's official APT repository.
Build the Docker Image:
Create a new directory for your Dockerfile:

bash
Copy code
mkdir jenkins-python-aws-docker-terraform && cd jenkins-python-aws-docker-terraform
Create the Dockerfile with the above content.

Build the Docker image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t jenkins-python-aws-docker-terraform .
Run the Docker container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -it jenkins-python-aws-docker-terraform
Notes:
Docker-in-Docker (DinD): If you want Jenkins jobs to run Docker commands, ensure that the Docker socket from the host machine is shared with the container by using the following command during the container run:

bash
Copy code
docker run -it --name my_jenkins_container -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock jenkins-python-aws-docker-terraform
This allows the Jenkins container to access Docker on the host.

Cleaning up: The apt-get clean and rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* commands are used to reduce the size of the Docker image by cleaning up package lists.

This custom image now includes Python 3, AWS CLI, Docker CLI, and Terraform, making it suitable for Jenkins jobs that require these tools.
