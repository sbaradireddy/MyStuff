Key Observations
Handling of POL_PK_CANCEL:

In QA logic:
sql
Copy code
ISNULL(POL_PK_CANCEL)
This explicitly checks if POL_PK_CANCEL is NULL.
In DEV logic:
sql
Copy code
POL_PK_CANCEL IS NULL
The difference in syntax may cause mismatches if POL_PK_CANCEL is not properly processed in the source.
No Significant Difference in Other Conditions:

Other conditions for DMV_TRANS_TYPE, ROW_STAT, and POL_PK are structurally the same.
The evaluation should behave identically unless the data or database functions behave differently in DEV and QA.
Steps to Debug and Resolve
1. Identify Impacted Records
To confirm that the difference in POL_PK_CANCEL handling causes the issue, isolate the POL_PK records that appear extra in DEV compared to QA.

Query for DEV:
sql
Copy code
SELECT POL_PK, DMV_TRANS_TYPE, ROW_STAT, POL_VRSN_TXN_TYP, REINST_TYP,
       POL_PK_REINSTATED_WITH_LAPSE, POL_PK_CANCEL, POL_PK_ADD_VEH,
       CASE
         WHEN DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'NB' AND SUBSTR(POL_VRSN_TXN_TYP, 1, 2) != 'EN' THEN 'Condition1'
         WHEN DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'RS' AND REINST_TYP = 'WITH LAPSE' THEN 'Condition2'
         WHEN DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'CN' AND ROW_STAT = 'C' THEN 'Condition3'
         WHEN DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'CN' AND ROW_STAT != 'C' AND POL_PK_REINSTATED_WITH_LAPSE > POL_PK THEN 'Condition4'
         WHEN DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'RS' AND REINST_TYP = 'REINSTATE' AND ROW_STAT = 'C' AND POL_PK_CANCEL IS NULL THEN 'Condition5'
         WHEN DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'AV' AND POL_PK = POL_PK_ADD_VEH THEN 'Condition6'
         ELSE 'Default'
       END AS CONDITION_TRIGGERED
FROM EXP_PRE_FILTER
WHERE POL_PK IN (83709650, 83499687, 83499688);
Query for QA:
Use the same query but run it in the QA environment.

Compare Results:
Focus on:

CONDITION_TRIGGERED: Does Condition5 (POL_PK_CANCEL IS NULL) trigger differently in DEV and QA?
Data Differences: Are there discrepancies in POL_PK_CANCEL values between DEV and QA?
2. Check NULL Handling Differences
Inconsistent handling of NULL values is a common cause of discrepancies.

Query for POL_PK_CANCEL Values:
sql
Copy code
SELECT POL_PK, POL_PK_CANCEL,
       CASE
         WHEN POL_PK_CANCEL IS NULL THEN 'NULL in DEV'
         ELSE 'Not NULL in DEV'
       END AS DEV_NULL_CHECK,
       CASE
         WHEN ISNULL(POL_PK_CANCEL) THEN 'NULL in QA'
         ELSE 'Not NULL in QA'
       END AS QA_NULL_CHECK
FROM EXP_PRE_FILTER
WHERE POL_PK IN (83709650, 83499687, 83499688);
Validate:
Does DEV correctly handle NULL using POL_PK_CANCEL IS NULL?
Does QA behave differently due to the use of ISNULL(POL_PK_CANCEL)?
3. Resolve the Issue
If the issue is due to NULL handling, align the DEV logic to use the same function (ISNULL) as QA:

Updated DEV Logic:
sql
Copy code
IFF(DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'NB' AND SUBSTR(POL_VRSN_TXN_TYP, 1, 2) != 'EN', 'N',
IFF(DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'RS' AND REINST_TYP = 'WITH LAPSE', 'N',
IFF(DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'CN' AND ROW_STAT = 'C', 'N',
IFF(DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'CN' AND ROW_STAT != 'C' AND POL_PK_REINSTATED_WITH_LAPSE > 0 AND POL_PK_REINSTATED_WITH_LAPSE > POL_PK, 'N',
IFF(DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'RS' AND REINST_TYP = 'REINSTATE' AND ROW_STAT = 'C' AND ISNULL(POL_PK_CANCEL), 'N',
IFF(DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'AV' AND POL_PK = POL_PK_ADD_VEH, 'N',
'Y'))))))
4. Validate the Fix
After updating the logic in DEV, re-run the comparison to ensure the extra records no longer appear.

Validation Query:
sql
Copy code
-- Compare rows in DEV but not in QA
SELECT POL_PK
FROM FILTRANS_DEV
MINUS
SELECT POL_PK
FROM FILTRANS_QA;
Summary of Fix
Align DEV logic with QA by using ISNULL for handling NULL values.
Validate all conditions (Condition1 to Condition6) using the debugging queries.
Re-run the comparison to confirm that no extra records appear in DEV.
