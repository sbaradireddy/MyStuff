. Compare the Data in DEV vs QA
Query in DEV: Extract the POL_PK records for the problematic entries (e.g., 83709650, 83499687, 83499688) in the FILTRANS dataset:

sql
Copy code
SELECT *
FROM FILTRANS
WHERE POL_PK IN (83709650, 83499687, 83499688);
Query in QA: Run the same query in qa to see if these records are present:

sql
Copy code
SELECT *
FROM FILTRANS
WHERE POL_PK IN (83709650, 83499687, 83499688);
2. Identify Differences in EXPTRANS1 Logic
Since FILTRANS is derived from EXPTRANS1, discrepancies may arise due to differences in the FILTER_OUT_IND logic. Compare the relevant logic for these specific records:

Debugging Query for EXPTRANS1 in DEV:
sql
Copy code
SELECT POL_PK, ROW_STAT, DMV_TRANS_TYPE, REINST_TYP, POL_VRSN_TXN_TYP,
       POL_PK_REINSTATED_WITH_LAPSE, POL_PK_CANCEL, POL_PK_ADD_VEH,
       CASE
           WHEN DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'NB' AND SUBSTR(POL_VRSN_TXN_TYP, 1, 2) != 'EN' THEN 'N'
           WHEN DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'RS' AND REINST_TYP = 'WITH LAPSE' THEN 'N'
           WHEN DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'CN' AND ROW_STAT = 'C' THEN 'N'
           WHEN DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'CN' AND ROW_STAT != 'C' AND POL_PK_REINSTATED_WITH_LAPSE > 0 AND 
                POL_PK_REINSTATED_WITH_LAPSE > POL_PK THEN 'N'
           WHEN DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'RS' AND REINST_TYP = 'REINSTATE' AND ROW_STAT = 'C' AND POL_PK_CANCEL IS NULL THEN 'N'
           WHEN DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'AV' AND POL_PK = POL_PK_ADD_VEH THEN 'N'
           ELSE 'Y'
       END AS FILTER_OUT_IND
FROM EXP_PRE_FILTER
WHERE POL_PK IN (83709650, 83499687, 83499688);
Debugging Query for EXPTRANS1 in QA:
Run the same query in qa and compare the outputs.

3. Check Key Conditions
Focus on the logic used in FILTER_OUT_IND. Here are the conditions:

Condition 1: DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'NB' AND SUBSTR(POL_VRSN_TXN_TYP, 1, 2) != 'EN'
Condition 2: DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'RS' AND REINST_TYP = 'WITH LAPSE'
Condition 3: DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'CN' AND ROW_STAT = 'C'
Condition 4: DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'CN' AND ROW_STAT != 'C' AND POL_PK_REINSTATED_WITH_LAPSE > POL_PK
Condition 5: DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'RS' AND REINST_TYP = 'REINSTATE' AND ROW_STAT = 'C' AND POL_PK_CANCEL IS NULL
Condition 6: DMV_TRANS_TYPE = 'AV' AND POL_PK = POL_PK_ADD_VEH
For the extra records in dev:

Verify which condition evaluates to TRUE for FILTER_OUT_IND = 'N'.
If the logic differs between dev and qa, ensure both environments use identical business rules.
4. Analyze Source Data Discrepancies
The issue may also stem from differences in the source table (EXP_PRE_FILTER).

Compare Source Data:
DEV Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT *
FROM EXP_PRE_FILTER
WHERE POL_PK IN (83709650, 83499687, 83499688);
QA Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT *
FROM EXP_PRE_FILTER
WHERE POL_PK IN (83709650, 83499687, 83499688);
Look for discrepancies in critical columns such as:

ROW_STAT
DMV_TRANS_TYPE
REINST_TYP
POL_PK_REINSTATED_WITH_LAPSE
POL_PK_CANCEL
POL_PK_ADD_VEH
5. Fix in DEV
Once you identify the root cause (logic issue or source data inconsistency), apply the fix:

Logic Issue:
Update the FILTER_OUT_IND logic in EXPTRANS1 to match the desired behavior.
Data Issue:
Correct the source data (EXP_PRE_FILTER) for the problematic records in dev.
6. Validate the Fix
After applying the fix, re-run the comparison queries to ensure no extra records exist in dev compared to qa.
